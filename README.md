# CM1705 Assessment Component 2 Q1
A Version Control System is extremely useful when creating software from large projects to individual personally developed software as it is very helpful in keeping track of the modification that the code has had over the course of a project. It also allows multiple users work in the same version of a piece of code, however Version Control Systems can be very crude but due to the usefulness of the internet Version Control Systems have been greatly innovated and expanded on, even reaching people who do coding has a hobby.

There are many different ways to implement Version Control System the most basic of which is to save a whole new, separate, file that is re-named to something like (code_v1, code_v2, code_v3, etc...) there are huge drawbacks to this method the main one being storage, as a new file is saved every time a change is made, so minor changes wouldn't be saved as much as that would require a massive amount of space when working on large projects, another drawback would be that different developers would be working on completely separate pieces of work as the file would be saved locally as if they are saved on a server, it could quickly run out of space if there are a large number of developers all working at the same time (saving multiple versions). Another issue could be two or more developers working on the same error for example and therefore being less efficient. There are positives to this method such as it could be somewhat useful for a single or small group of developers working on a small project as there would be much less storage used and for a single developers case, no clashes would happen so efficiency wouldn't be impacted. This Version Control System is also extremly useful as of the internet were to go out then the code can still be iterated on as there is no reliance on the intnet as evrything is saved locally or on a local server if working in an office that hosts a server. But as we can see this method has too many cons to the pros that it offeres so developers have been innovating to tackle the problems the most basic Version Control System faces...

This is where we enter the world of Git and Github, Git tackles the problem of storage as it would be installed on a machine, where Git would then make a record of all the changes made but in a much more storage friendly way and allow a wonderful thing of braches where independent local branches of code would be self-contained so if the user would wonder what changing a part of some code would do, they could, withought completely destorying the rest of the code (if that would happen) and just reset back to the main version, but, if the changes made the code more effiecient for example, the user could merge the branch and make it appart of the main code. Git can also be used withought internet too! making it very useful.

Where Git tackles the problem of storage and version history, Github tackles the problem of collaboration that is faced when developers are saving their work on seperate files. Github tackles this problem by hosting all code on a cloud service, Github allows for multiple developers to work on the same piece of code whithought impacting efficiency of the developers by use of Pull requests where a developer can change a section of code and send a pull request to the - for example - lead developer where they would review the work (even create a branch with it to test) and deem it reasonable to implement in the main code, Github also allows users to add comments on issues and forums for users to discuss what could be changed, added, remove etc... and as all code is open source the users can really see what they are installing and how they could iterate on the code by use of forks where a user can create a copy and use it for inspiration for their own works.
